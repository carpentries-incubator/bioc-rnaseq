RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) has revolutionized the field of genomics, enabling researchers to gain insights into gene expression, transcriptome dynamics, and molecular pathways. [Bioconductor](https://bioconductor.org/) is an open-source software project that provides a rich set of tools for analyzing high-throughput genomic data, including RNA-seq data. This [Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/)-style workshop is designed to equip participants with the essential skills and knowledge needed to analyze RNA-seq data using the Bioconductor ecosystem. Throughout this workshop, you will delve into key concepts, including data preprocessing, quality control, differential gene expression analysis, visualization of results, and gene set analysis.
